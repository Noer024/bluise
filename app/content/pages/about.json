This has then evolved to become a product consumed by other teams elsewhere in the business and I remain a vital source of knowledge for implementation and use of this key business resource. Accompanying Windows Services have also been created using TopShelf to assist in facilitating other core business-critical services of which I had a major hand in since inception.\n\n\nOften working to a goal of MVP, deployment of larger features is often done in an A/B testing style to sales agents in the business. This allows us to evaluate the changes with specific members of staff and develop a feedback loop that allows us to enhance on this original MVP product before it is exposed to the broader sales team.\n\n\nWith the growth of the system I have completed the integration of third-party and internal APIs.\nOur team has received recognition, via the internal awards system, by the departments we work alongside.\nThis role has exposed me to many technologies both front and back-end including React, ASP.net MVC, ASP Core, Lambdas, SQS, SNS. As well as deployment tools such as Octopus, Team City, Git and BitBucket.\n\n\nWithin this role I have been able to develop my skills as both a software developer but have also played a role in the growth of the IT department by assisting in the interview process for new candidates. Additionally, I have helped the development of the department itself by running a lunchtime/brown-bag style session to highlight new features that have been added to the AWS cloud platform that we use.\n\n## \nSoftware Development Manager\n\n### \nJenison Ltd, Hedge End, Hampshire (March 2016– February 2017)\n\n\nI was responsible for the development, setup, maintenance and support of e-learning software and business-critical web applications provided across the world. \n\n\nAs the most senior developer within the company I had a pivotal role in steering the business to improve IT infrastructure. This included moving the company away from traditional, static infrastructure provided by Rackspace to the cloud-based Microsoft Azure platform. This allowed our products to react to the ever-changing demand of a global provider of e-learning.\n\n\nIt was also one of my major goals to move the IT department to a more formal setting for planning & development which included implementing of Team Foundation Online. This allowed us then to move towards an Agile way of planning for the future of our products. As part of this migration I also migrated the company’s email provider from Rackspace to Office 365.\n\n\nWith the removal of IE6 as a barrier to backwards compatibility for our products, I took the opportunity to re-write the company’s cloud-based platform for the delivery of e-learning content. Moving the content to a Blob-storage-backed CDN which was delivered via an enhanced API that had a simpler, user-friendly interface for our client’s to download their content snippets to deliver within their e-learning platform.\n\n\nI also mentored and trained new software developers within the company and existing staff from all departments in the varying technologies used. I also perform other duties such as business and consumer support/relations and internal IT administration.\n\n## \nSoftware Developer\n\n### \nJenison Ltd, Hedge End, UK (October 2012– March 2016)\n\n## \nSoftware Development Intern\n\n### \nColoni Ltd, Bursledon, UK (2012)\n\n\nThis was a 4-month long internship at an e-learning-based and web applications development company. My duties included support, QA and development of systems for large-scale companies which included national banks and security firms.\n\n## \nEducation\n\n\nBSc (Hons) Computer Games Development (2:1)\nSouthampton Solent University (2009 – 2012)\n\n\n4 A-Levels (Computing, Economics, Mathematics, General Studies)\nSeevic College, Benfleet, Essex (2007 – 2009)\n\n## Additional Information\n\n\nFull UK Driving Licence \n\n\nFire Marshall\n\n\nHobbies/Interests\n\n\nLive music, gym, kickboxing, films and TV, web design\n\n\n**References available upon request.**"
